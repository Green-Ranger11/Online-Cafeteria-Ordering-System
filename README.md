# Cafeteria Ordering System

This is a online food ordering system where you can order your meals online. This is for CS415 at the University of the South Pacific. This was built in .Net Core and Angular v9.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* .NET Core Sdk v3.0 or greater <br />
* POSTMAN - For testing suites for the API  <br />
* SQL Server 2016 or greater Note: This application was initially built on SQLite and configurations have already been made to take care of SQLite's drawbacks should you choose to use SQLite as your database <br />
* Node.js <br />
* Angular CLI <br />
* Stripe CLI <br />
* Redis 64Bit - Probably want to use Chocolatey to install otherwise its a headache <br />
* Code Editor or IDE like VS Code, VS Studio or Rider <br />

### Installing

1. Install .NET Core Sdk and Runtime from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2. If you're using Visual Studio 2017 or greater you may already have SQL Server if not go into Visual Studio Installer and tick SQL Server. Otherwise
head [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and get the developer version, its free.
